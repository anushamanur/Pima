# Pima

### About
The objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements using Neural Networks.

### Dataset
This implementation uses he wilt dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 33% of the dataset is considered for testing.

##### Attributes
1. Number of times pregnant
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age (years)
9. Class variable (0 or 1)

### Implementation
Python and its various toolkits have been used in the classification of diseased tree images using neural networks.
* Keras - a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
* Numpy - a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* Scikit-learn - a machine learning library for Python.

### Performance
Performance : 78.74 % ( for 500 epochs)
